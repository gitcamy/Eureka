Spain isn't just a country—it's a lifestyle. Safe, affordable, stunningly beautiful, with unbeatable weather, rich culture, and a vibrant vibe that just can't be matched. Smart choice!",
  "Now, let's get to the fun part—making it happen.",
  "You'll need a local expert to help you find the right spot in Spain that fits your personal needs. You'll want a realtor and real estate consultant to help you find the perfect home. You'll need someone to fight for your interests on the ground, navigating the local system. And you'll want an advisor who's got your back through the whole relocation process—visa management, taxes, moving prep, and settling into the community.",
